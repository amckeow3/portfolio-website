        My name is Adrianna McKeown and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I have a BSBA in Management Information Systems and I am currently pursuing an MS degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Software Systems Design &
        Engineering. I am ardent about building and advancing my knowledge of the latest computer-based technologies and I am proficient in a range of languages and tools. Passionate about diversity in tech and inspiring other girls to pursue careers in
        STEM, I spend a good bit of my free time volunteering at UNC Charlotte's STEM pre-college helping to promote organizations such as Girls Who Code.

        Apart from technology, I am a Boston sports fanatic and Disney lover. I also enjoy running and being active. You can find me watching a Patriots game,
        training for a half marathon, or planning my next vacation to Disney World.
